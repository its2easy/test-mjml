          <p>
            By the time you start reading this sentence, you have already made up your mind. In fact, your brain only took ⅒ of a second to get an impression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting the reader's attention is not easy at all. Because your company is not the only one that wants to attract attention. There are approx. 10,000 other advertising messages to which your customers are exposed daily. Obviously, nobody can take up this amount of messages. The result: advertising blindness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution: direct news. In a world, in which advertisement is increasingly addressed to the broad mass, nothing attracts more attention than a personal message. It's therefore no coincidence that email marketing is currently experiencing a renaissance. Thanks to legal regulations that prevent the sending of unsolicited advertising and spam mails, today only those messages that really interest the recipients end up in their mailboxes. The newsletter is thus becoming the most important tool in the online marketing mix directly after the website. As such, its planning and design deserve special attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make it all easier for you, we have now published our boilerplate project for emails on GitHub.
